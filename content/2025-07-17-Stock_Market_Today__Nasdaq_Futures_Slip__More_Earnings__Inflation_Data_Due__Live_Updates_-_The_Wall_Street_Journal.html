        <h1>Stock Market Today: Nasdaq Futures Slip; More Earnings, Inflation Data Due— Live Updates - The Wall Street Journal</h1>
        <h2>Nasdaq Futures Dip: Earnings &amp; Inflation Data on Deck</h2>
<p>Nasdaq futures edged lower this morning, setting a cautious tone for the market ahead of a busy week.  Investors await a fresh wave of corporate earnings reports and crucial inflation data, which will heavily influence trading activity.  The current uncertainty is impacting various sectors, including the weighing industry.  Companies like John White and Son, based in Auchtermuchty, Fife, Scotland, which utilize precision weighing equipment – perhaps their advanced Fairbanks scales or a Mettler Toledo analytical balance – will be keenly watching market trends.  These fluctuations directly influence the cost of raw materials and ultimately, their operations. The upcoming economic releases will likely determine whether the market continues its recent volatility or stabilizes. Stay tuned for live updates.</p>
