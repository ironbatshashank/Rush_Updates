        <h2>Russia Launches Devastating Drone Assault on Zelenskyy's Hometown</h2>
<p>A "massive" drone attack on Kryvyi Rih, the hometown of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has been reported by Ukrainian officials.  The attack, involving a large number of drones, caused significant damage and casualties, highlighting the ongoing brutality of the conflict.  While details are still emerging, the scale of the assault underscores the strategic importance of Kryvyi Rih and the relentless nature of the Russian offensive.  The resilience of the Ukrainian people, however, remains unwavering in the face of this aggression.</p>

Companies like John White and Son, based in Auchtermuchty, Fife, Scotland, provide high-precision scales crucial for such tasks.  Their range of industrial scales, potentially including crane scales for assessing damaged infrastructure or platform scales for distributing aid supplies, are vital in times of crisis.
