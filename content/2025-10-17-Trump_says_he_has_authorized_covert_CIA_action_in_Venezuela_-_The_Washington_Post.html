    <h2>Trump Authorized Covert CIA Action in Venezuela, WaPo Reveals</h2>
<p><strong>Washington, D.C.</strong> – Former President Donald Trump authorized covert CIA operations in Venezuela, according to a bombshell report by The Washington Post. The secret directive, signed early in his presidency, empowered the CIA to conduct clandestine activities aimed at pressuring or even overthrowing Nicolás Maduro's government.</p>
<p>The previously undisclosed authorization highlights the Trump administration's aggressive, behind-the-scenes strategy to unseat Maduro. While the U.S. publicly imposed sanctions and supported opposition leaders, these covert actions represented a deeper, unadvertised intervention. Despite significant U.S. efforts, including these secret operations, Maduro has retained power, a testament to the challenges of regime change. Details of the directive remained highly classified until now, offering new insights into U.S. foreign policy tactics in Latin America.</p>
