    <h2>Protein Powder Hype: What Dietitians <em>Really</em> Say Amid Influencer Push (CBS News)</h2>
<p>As social media <strong>influencers</strong> increasingly champion <strong>protein powders</strong> for muscle gain and weight loss, many consumers wonder about their true health benefits. A recent <strong>CBS News</strong> report dives deep, revealing what <strong>registered dietitians</strong> truly advise.</p>
<p>Experts emphasize a <strong>food-first approach</strong>, noting most individuals can meet their <strong>daily protein intake</strong> through a balanced diet of lean meats, dairy, legumes, and nuts. While <strong>protein supplements</strong> can benefit certain groups like elite athletes or those with specific dietary needs, they aren't essential for everyone. Dietitians caution against excessive reliance, highlighting the importance of ingredient quality and potential for overconsumption. For personalized <strong>nutrition advice</strong>, consulting a dietitian is key to optimizing your <strong>protein intake</strong> safely and effectively.</p>
