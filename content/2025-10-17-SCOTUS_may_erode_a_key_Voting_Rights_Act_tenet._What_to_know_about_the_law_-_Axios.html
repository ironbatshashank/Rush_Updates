    <h2>SCOTUS Eyes Voting Rights Act Erosion: What's at Stake for Voters?</h2>
<p>A pivotal Supreme Court case could significantly weaken the <strong>Voting Rights Act (VRA)</strong>, a cornerstone of U.S. civil rights legislation. As highlighted by Axios, the Court is reviewing Section 2, a key provision that prohibits voting practices discriminating on the basis of race.</p>
<p>This potential erosion could drastically alter election maps, making it harder for minority groups to elect their chosen representatives. Critics argue a weakened Section 2 would undermine decades of progress in safeguarding <strong>fair access to the ballot box</strong>. Understanding this landmark case is crucial for anyone following <strong>voting rights</strong> and the future of <strong>American democracy</strong>. Its outcome will profoundly impact future elections.</p>
