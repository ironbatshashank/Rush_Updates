    <p><strong>Brown University Rejects Trump’s ‘Free Speech’ Compact</strong></p>
<p>Brown University has officially rejected the Trump administration’s controversial "free speech" compact, a condition tied to federal research funding. As reported by The Hill, the Providence institution cited concerns that the agreement would undermine academic freedom and institutional autonomy.</p>
<p>University leadership argued that the compact, meant to promote free expression, could inadvertently "chill" speech rather than protect it. This decision highlights ongoing tensions between federal oversight and higher education’s independence concerning campus expression policies. Brown's stance reinforces a broader debate on the role of government in university affairs and the delicate balance of free speech on campuses.</p>
