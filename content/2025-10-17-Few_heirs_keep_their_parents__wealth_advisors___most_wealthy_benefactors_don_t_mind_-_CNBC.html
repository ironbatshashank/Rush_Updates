    <h1>Few heirs keep their parents' wealth advisors — most wealthy benefactors don't mind - CNBC</h1>
    <span class="date">17 Oct 2025</span>
    <h2>Next-Gen Wealth: Heirs Opt For New Financial Advisors, Parents Approve</h2>
<p>A recent CNBC report reveals a significant trend in <strong>wealth management</strong>: most heirs rarely retain their parents' long-time <strong>wealth advisors</strong>. Surprisingly, wealthy benefactors largely accept this shift.</p>
<p>This generational divergence isn't about disloyalty. Younger inheritors often seek <strong>financial planning</strong> that aligns with their unique life stages, risk appetites, and investment philosophies, which may differ from their parents'. Advisors who managed established wealth for decades might not be the ideal fit for emerging beneficiaries. Parents, prioritizing their children's financial well-being and successful <strong>wealth transfer</strong>, generally support their decision to find a more suitable <strong>financial advisor</strong>. This highlights a focus on future financial security over legacy relationships.</p>
